### Overview
This is the bot that we created for A1 and A2. The users are going to be typing in a window on what their issues are. And the bot reads the users' issues then give them the solution accordingly. In this assignment I added 2 APIs to the bot that upgrades it by providing more functions. the first one asks the user to type in their address(like address:802 Academy Way) then a google map would pop out. The second one can be used by asking the bot what is certain food (what is poutine), the bot would take some texts from wikipedia then display them. With these functions, we can provide a more complete service to our users.
### APIs
1. Google Map API: Sometimes the customers' house are located at a more hidden place or inside a community. This would cause the food deliver to get lost and thus the delivery might be late. If the customers feel like their food should be delivered earlier they could report the issue to the bot. The customers can type in their address with more detail and the bot would display the map of that address to the user. With this function we could know their location better and provide a faster deliver next time.\
2. Wikipedia API: In our menu of the foods, there are some foods that are from other countries. The users might not know and would like to know what kind of food that is. Therefore, the bot would extract some part of the contents from the wikipedia search if the users input some specific words like "what is paella.".
